# SalesforceStreamer

A wrapper around the Restforce Streaming API to receive real time updates from
your Salesforce instance with a built-in PushTopic manager.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'salesforce_streamer'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

## Usage

### Configure Push Topics

Create a YAML file to configure your server subscriptions.  The configuration
for each subscription must have a nested `salesforce:` key. These settings will
be synced to your Salesforce instance when the `-x` flag is set on the command
line. For more information about the `replay:` and `notify_fields_for` options
please see the Salesforce Streaming API reference documentation.

```yaml
# config/streamer.yml
---
base: &DEFAULT
  accounts:
    handler: "AccountChangeHandler"
    replay: -1
    salesforce:
      name: "AllAccounts"
      api_version: "41.0"
      description: "Sync Accounts"
      notify_for_fields: "Referenced"
      query: "Select Id, Name From Account"

development:
  <<: *DEFAULT

test:
  <<: *DEFAULT

production:
  <<: *DEFAULT
```

It's important to note that the way push topics are managed is by the Salesforce
name attribute.  This should uniquely identify each push topic.  It is not
recommended to change the name of your push topic definitions; otherwise, the
push topic manager will not find a push topic in Salesforce resulting in the
creation of a brand new push topic. If the push topic manager identifies a
difference in any of the other Salesforce attributes, then it will update the
push topic in Salesforce before starting the streaming server.

### Define Message Handlers

Define your handlers somewhere in your project. They must respond to either
`.perform_async(str)` or `.call(str)`.

```ruby
# lib/account_change_handler.rb
# Handle account changes inline
class AccountChangeHandler
  def self.call(message)
    puts message
  end
end

# Handle account changes asynchronously
class AccountChangeHandler
  include Sidekiq::Worker
  def perform(message)
    puts message
  end
end
```

### Prepare The Environment

Set your Restforce ENV variables in order to establish a connection. See the
Restforce API documentation for more details. Then start the server using the
command line interface.

Configure the `SalesforceStreamer` module.

```ruby
# config/initializers/salesforce_streamer.rb

require 'redis'
require 'connection_pool'

SalesforceStreamer.config.redis_connection = ConnectionPool.new(size: 5, timeout: 5) { Redis.new }
SalesforceStreamer.config.logger = Logger.new(STDERR, level: 'INFO')
SalesforceStreamer.config.exception_adapter = proc { |e| puts e }
SalesforceStreamer.config.manage_topics = true
```

### Launch The Streamer

Launch the `streamer` service loads the application code at
`./config/environment` by default if `config.require_path` is unset. It will
load your push topic configuration from `./config/streamer.yml` if
`config.config_file` is unset. During the boot sequence it will connect to
Salesforce using the Restforce client and your configured ENV variables in order
to upsert push topic definitions.

```
$ bundle exec streamer
I, [2019-07-08T22:16:34.104271 #26973]  INFO -- : Launching Streamer Services
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:55.862351 #78537]  INFO -- : Running Topic Manager
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:56.860998 #78537]  INFO -- : New PushTopic AllAccounts
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:56.861079 #78537]  INFO -- : Upsert PushTopic AllAccounts
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:56.861109 #78537]  INFO -- : Skipping upsert because manage topics is off
I, [2019-07-08T22:16:34.794933 #26973]  INFO -- : Starting Server
```

By default, the server will start up without syncing the push topic configuration.
Set the configuration option `config.manage_topics = true` will tell the server
launcher to update the configuration of the push topic in Salesforce.

```
$ bundle exec streamer
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:55.862296 #78537]  INFO -- : Launching Streamer Services
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:55.862351 #78537]  INFO -- : Running Topic Manager
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:56.860998 #78537]  INFO -- : New PushTopic AllAccounts
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:56.861079 #78537]  INFO -- : Upsert PushTopic AllAccounts
I, [2019-07-09T15:19:57.591241 #78537]  INFO -- : Starting Server
```

By default, the executable will load the YAML based on the `RACK_ENV` environment
variable, or default to `:development` if not set. You can override this by
setting the `config.environment = :integration`

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake rspec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
